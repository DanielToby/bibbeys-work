  A creative multimedia portfolio, for a friend.
</h1>

I built this static portfolio using Gatsby JS, to sharpen my frontend skills with React and learn Node for the first time. Data from the site is stored in a Content Management System called Contentful. By creating a content model unique to our needs, Josh can edit site data, contact information, images, projects and photos from the [contentful site](https://contentful.com). 

The site is built and deployed in the cloud using Netlify. Netlify creates a VM to build the site, which executes node API calls and generates a static site. Commits to this repo queue redeploys, which also occur automatically.

This combination of Gatsby, React, Contentful, and Netlify provides a powerful toolkit to build a unique and performant personal site, without the need for Josh to edit code and risk breaking the site, or worry about a development environement on his computer. 

I completed this project in quarantine, while waiting to start a new job. Josh is my roommate, and needed a flashy site for his work as a multimedia designer. All in all, the only cost to us was for the domain.
