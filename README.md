  A multimedia portfolio for a friend (who doesn't code).

Demo: [bibbeyswork.com](https://bibbeyswork.com)

I built this static portfolio using Gatsby JS, to sharpen my frontend skills with React and learn Node for the first time. Data from the site is stored in a Content Management System called Contentful. By creating a content model unique to our needs, Josh can edit site data, contact information, images, projects, and photos -- all from the [contentful website](https://contentful.com). 

The site is built and deployed in the cloud using Netlify. Netlify automatically initializes a VM for building, which then executes node API calls to generate content. Commits to this repo queue redeploys, which also occur automatically.

This combination of Gatsby, React, Contentful, and Netlify provides a powerful toolkit to build a unique and performant personal site, without the need for Josh to edit code, push breaking changes, or worry about a development environment on his computer. 

I completed this project in quarantine while waiting to start a new job. Josh, my roommate, needed a flashy site for his work as a multimedia designer. All in all, the only cost to us was the domain.
